        Cake is a flour confection made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients and is
        usually baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes
        now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate and which
        share features with desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.
        The most common ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, fat (such as butter, oil, or margarine),
        a liquid, and a leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder. Common 
        additional ingredients include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and 
        extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. 
        Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts, or dessert sauces (like custard, 
        jelly, cooked fruit, whipped cream, or syrups),iced with buttercream or other icings,
        and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.
        Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings,
        anniversaries, and birthdays.

    <p>A cookie (American English) or biscuit (British English) is a baked snack or dessert that
        is typically small, flat, and sweet. It usually contains flour, sugar, egg, and some 
        type of oil, fat, or butter. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, 
        chocolate chips, or nuts.
        Most English-speaking countries call crunchy cookies "biscuits", except for the United 
        States and Canada, where "biscuit" refers to a type of quick bread. Chewier biscuits are 
        sometimes called "cookies" even in the United Kingdom.[3] Some cookies may also be named 
        by their shape, such as date squares or bars.
        Biscuit or cookie variants include sandwich biscuits, such as custard creams, Jammie 
        Dodgers, Bourbons, and Oreos, with marshmallows or jam filling and sometimes dipped in 
        chocolate or another sweet coating.</p>

        A cinnamon roll is a sweet baked dough filled with a cinnamon-sugar filling. 
        Made with a rich dough leavened with yeast, their characteristic form is due 
        to rolling a dough sheet containing sweetened cinnamon filling.
        A sweet roll or sweet bun refers to any of a number of sweet, baked, yeast-leavened
        breakfast or dessert foods. They may contain spices, nuts, candied fruits, etc., 
        and are often glazed or topped with icing. Compared to regular bread dough, 
        sweet roll dough generally has higher levels of sugar, fat, eggs, and yeast.
        They are often round, and are small enough to comprise a single serving.
        These differ from pastries, which are made from a paste-like batter;
        from cakes, which are typically unleavened or chemically leavened;
        and from doughnuts, which are deep fried.
        Refrigerated ready-to-bake sweet roll dough is commercially available in grocery stores.
        Sweet rolls are sometimes iced and/or contain a sweet filling.
